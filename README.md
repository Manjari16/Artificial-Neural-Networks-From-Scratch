# Artificial-Neural-Networks-From-Scratch

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the human brain's neural structure. They consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons that process input data and learn from it to make predictions. ANNs are widely used for various tasks, such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition, thanks to their ability to learn complex relationships in data through a process called training, which involves adjusting the connections (weights) between neurons.
